**Mayor** of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham, speaking on BBC Radio Manchester on 2 January, said: “I think we do have to have a look back at the warnings. We were all taken by surprise to some degree. There was **no named storm**. There was **not a particular warning the authorities gave**.

The **Environment Agency** did not comment but pointed out that it has committed **£2.4 billion to invest** over the next two years to protect people from flooding, and has plans to consult on a new strategic vision for flood investment.

**Frequent Flood History**: Multiple significant flooding events in 1816, 1866, 1946, 1954, 1980, 2007, 2015, and 2020. 

**Policy and Planning Challenges**: Policy implementation and planning coordination when managing flood risks.

**Social Vulnerability**: As the third most populous county, the area has significant social vulnerability, with low-income and marginalized communities being more susceptible to flood risks.

    <ol>
      <li><strong>Data Timeliness and Frequency Issues</strong>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Problem</strong>: Satellite imagery (e.g., Landsat, Sentinel-2) has long revisit periods (8 days for Landsat 8, 5 days for Sentinel-2), delaying real-time flood monitoring.</li>
          <li><strong>Solution</strong>: Integrate high-frequency data (e.g., Sentinel-1 SAR) with drones for real-time, frequent flood monitoring.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Cloud Interference Issues</strong>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Problem</strong>: Optical remote sensing imagery is impacted by cloud cover, hindering data acquisition in cloudy/rainy conditions.</li>
          <li><strong>Solution</strong>: Use SAR data (e.g., Sentinel-1), unaffected by clouds, for continuous all-weather monitoring.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Flood Warning and Emergency Response Capacity</strong>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Problem</strong>: Complex terrain and poor infrastructure hinder accuracy and timeliness in some regions.</li>
          <li><strong>Solution</strong>: Integrate real-time data analysis and multi-source fusion (remote sensing, meteorology, sensors) to improve warning accuracy and speed.</li>

      <li><strong>Insufficient Community Engagement and Education</strong>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Problem</strong>: Lack of awareness and response ability to flood risks, especially in economically disadvantaged areas, despite government efforts.</li>
          <li><strong>Solution</strong>: Enhance community education and participation with flood history maps and real-time monitoring apps to boost preparedness and response.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Limitations of Traditional Flood Control Measures</strong>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Problem</strong>: Over-reliance on traditional engineering measures (e.g., embankments, drainage systems), facing maintenance issues and limited effectiveness.</li>
          <li><strong>Solution</strong>: Introduce nature-based solutions (e.g., wetland restoration, tree planting) alongside traditional measures to improve sustainability and reduce dependency on hard infrastructure.</li>
